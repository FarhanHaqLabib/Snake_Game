## 🎮 Project Overview

This project is a simple version of the classic **Snake Game**, fully implemented in **C**, using only standard libraries and Windows console functions.\
The game demonstrates:

- Real-time keyboard input without blocking
- Basic use of structs (`gamestate`, `position`)
- Enums to manage directions
- Console-based rendering with ASCII graphics
- A game loop that updates continuously
- Modular design with separate functions (`setup()`, `draw()`, `input()`, `logic()`)

We are developing this collaboratively with **GitHub version control**, ensuring clear commit history, teamwork, and good coding practices.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Snake moves in four directions: W, A, S, D keys
- ✅ Detects collision with walls and ends the game
- 🔄 Random food spawning (in progress)
- 🔄 Score counter updates when food is eaten
- 🔄 Snake grows longer after eating food
- 🔄 Self-collision detection to end the game if the snake hits itself

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the folder:**

   ```bash
   cd snake-game-project
   ```

3. **Compile the code:**

   ```bash
   gcc snake.c -o snake.exe
   ```

## 📸 Demo

We will upload a **1-minute screen recording** here showing the game running smoothly, with food spawning, snake growing, and score updating.
